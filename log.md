# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 13 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started working on Wes Bos Javascript30 Course. And did a challenge on coderbyte.com

**Thoughts:** Getting better with Javascript feels amazing and added an additional feature to the Wes Bos Drum Kit set. Finishing a challenge on coderbyte made me really euphoric even though it was an easy one, but we all have to start somewhere :)

### Day 2: November 14 2018

**Today's Progress**: Day 2 with Wes Bos Javascript30 Course. Did the Clock and added an additional feature that shows us the time visually underneath the Clock. Goal is to implement a little feature additional to the project.

**Thoughts:** I learned some new tricks with CSS and how to work with Date Methods within Javascript. I digged a bit deeper into things I did not knew about which made me understand certains things better and jotted some notes down. Even if I do not look into the notes that often, or at all, it helps me manifest my thoughts better if I write them down and not just let them float around in my head.

### Day 3: November 15 2018

**Today's Progress**: Day 3 with Wes Bos Javascript30 Course. Learned some niffty tricks with CSS Variables and how to access them in Javascript. The additional feature I've added today is a quick color bar, where folks can click a color which then get applied instead of using the color picker.

**Thoughts:** The additional feature was really fun to code and harder then expected. But I learned how to get CSS properties within Javascript and save them to a variable to work with them and apply them to different elements. I get a little the hang of the keyword `this` which is pretty cool. It's super cool to add an additional feature to each exercise to become more creative and to deepen the understanding of each tutorial and also make it more unique. This challenge each day is really my highlight of the day! Also, instead of one hour of coding it was all of a sudden 3 hours! It's so much fun and I really hope that one day I can fulfill my dream to work in the industry and contribute to the tech industry!

### Day 4: November 16 2018

**Today's Progress**: Day 4 with Wes Bos Javascript30 Course. I learned in a hardcore array cardio session more about the array methods (map, filter, reduce, sort). I could take away some cool tricks and tips and will re-iterite the next few days.

**Thoughts:** Arrays are a pretty hard topic to grasp, at least for me, so far. I mean I get the methods but defo have to work on how it all works together. I have to re-iterite the exercises and really understand the concepts. I dug deeper into the sort() method and had to google why and how it sorts. I found out the JS Engine uses a sort algorithm and runs several times through arrays to sort them. We pass (a, b) in arguments and then can basically tell Javascript how we want to have it sort. In my case we used the return 1, return -1 statements to let it Bubble Sort up and down. It is still not 100% clear to me but practice makes perfect I guess. I really hope I get a better understanding in those. I have to work everyday on some arrays to really get the hang of it.

### Day 5: November 17 2018

**Today's Progress**: Day 5 with Wes Bos Javascript30 Course. Today we built an Image Gallery that relied heavily on Flexbox. If you click a panel it grows larger and text swoops in from the top and bottom. On another click the panel closes down again.

**Thoughts:** Was an awesome exercise. I was able to solo the exercise without watching the video, just the intro from Wes. I used arrays, and alot of methods I learned from the cardio yesterday and from the last few days. Although I could've done way easier probably, I'm pretty stoked that I actually was able to solve it and use the array methods. Coding everyday literally is great and the habit is what makes me stronger in coding and also the best practice! GO GO GO! :)

### Day 6: November 18 2018

**Today's Progress**: Day 6 with Wes Bos Javascript30 Course. This project was about how to fetch data from a JSON file and how to filter data out of a massive array and dynamically look through the array and show the results on the DOM. We used RegEx and data from an external JSON file. The array contained data about Cities and states in the USA. Also population and other information. Our goal was it that on user input the array gets searched with states and cities which are matching to the entered value. It also showed the population of the cities.
The second project I worked on was building a landing page for a client. I finished the HTML structure and also most of the CSS for the mobile version. I decided to build mobile first this time, from previous projects lessons learned.

**Thoughts:** The Javascript30 course gets really interesting and a bit harder. I have to look more into Regular Expressions are deepen my understanding how fetch and promises work. I think I could take away quite some knowledge and hope to apply it on something soon.
I am getting pretty fast in single HTML and CSS projects right now. I was able to finish most of the HTML structure for the landing page and most of the layout and CSS in an hour so two. It is just for mobile yet but I think the mobile first approach will work better out compared to desktop design first in previous iterations.

### Day 7: November 19 2018

**Today's Progress**: Day 7 with Wes Bos Javascript30 Course. We covered more array methods, like - .sort() .find() - and some more. Quite useful, now I jsut have to practice way more and use these methods dailies to get into it and get a better understanding of them.
I also finished the Huddle Landing Page with repsonsive design first.

**Thoughts:** I learn a shit tonne new Javascript every day now. It is quite hard to remember all of it, but I mostly get the concepts and think I can already do some cool stuff. I want to really find a little side project which I can make to manifest and cement what I've learned in my head.
I also finished the Huddle Landing page for the Coding challenge. I must say I am getting quite fast with just pure CSS and HTML. Although I'm gettign fast I have to get way better with my CSS I think. My mobile first approach worked out pretty cool, but my CSS still looks quite messy. But I'm having more fun with Javascript at the moment :p.

### Day 8: November 20 2018

**Today's Progress**: Day 8 with Wes Bos Javascript30 Course. The project was about HTML5 Canvas and how to manipulate and do fun things with it in Javascript. So when the user press' a mousekey down it would draw something on the canvas. We used HSL colors for that and as the hsl value increased so does the line. If the hsl value reaches its max of 360 it gets set back to 0 and start anew.

**Thoughts:** Canvas seems to be pretty tricky. If I want to use this I need to reference back to this project. It was a lot to take and kudos to Wes to learn and teach all that stuff. So yeah, learned a bit how to use and work with canvas in JS and make it interactive. Haven't used Canvas at all yet so it was something very new for me but really interesting. I have to keep it up!

### Day 9: November 21 2018

**Today's Progress**: Day 9 with Wes Bos Javascript30 Course. Today's tutorial was about some neat tricks what we can do within the Chrome Dev Tools. I also started a small project that will calculate and compare the BMI of 2 people. I did the HTML and styles and was able to get some variables declared and the function that runs the calculations is done but not yet complete.

**Thoughts:** THe tips and tricks for the Dev Tools in Chrome are very neat and I hope to utilise those further in my learning. The BMI calclator is a nice and easy project to get started and get more familiar with working in the DOM. I had some struggles with the Form element. I have to read further into this how to work with Forms within Javascript. But I was happy that I could figure a bug out why my calculations wouldn't show up in the console (hint: FORM!!)

### Day 10: November 22 2018

**Today's Progress**: Day 10 with Wes Bos Javascript30 Course. I started a project which lets you check several boxes within a range what you checked while holding down the shift key. I started it without watching Wes' Tutorial. I was able to find out that there is a method .shiftKey. I could get the index of the checked items. I still need to find out how to save the index and get the items in between the two checked boxed to be checked then.

**Thoughts:** It was pretty hard for me to do on my own. But I could make a slow progress and played with some methods and just went the trial and error path. Some things worked out but mostly not yet. Also I was sick. :D But I think with some more persistence and maybe having a sneak at the tutorial I'll figure it out somehow.

**Link to work:** [Check multiple boxes with shift](https://github.com/drood87/check-multiple-boxes-with-shift)

### Day 12: November 23 2018

**Today's Progress**: I learned about npm packages and had my first real contact to .json files.I could add scripts in the .json that would run scripts from the terminal. I learned a little about how to import packages from npm and what dependencies in a project are. What are the benefits (re-usable code from other Dev's so we don't have to) and disadvantages (bloated projects, large file sizes, alot of dependencies are hard to maintain) of it.

**Thoughts:** Today I took a day off of hardcore coding and got a bit familiar with npm and dependencies and some nice packages what we can use from npm. It was nice to get the head off a little bit and learn something new exciting. Can't wait to play around more with it.

### Day 13: November 24 2018

**Today's Progress**: We build a custom HTML5 video player with Javascript. It allows you to scrub through the video, change volume and videospeed.
Also, I started a coding challenge which allows you to calculate the average score of three different teams from three different games and then tells us who won in average.
I started the design with HTML and CSS, using flexbox.

**Thoughts:** The Javascript30 is getting pretty tough for my knowledge but it's amazing what we can do with just these technologies. I will try to get a bit more familiar with more the basics and do the coding challenges from the other Udemy course to double down on the basics and then incrementely do more complicated stuff. I have fun working with the DOM and really have to learn to concentrate on one project instead of trying to do all at once.

**Link to work:** [Video Player](https://github.com/drood87/custom-html5-video-player)

### Day 14: November 25 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the coding challenge of the average winner. Implemented a regular Expression(yay) and some of the array methods. So far it works great. I used the animate.css library to animate my image and my Regular Expression validates that the user only inputs numbers and not any characters.

**Thoughts:** Wow, today was actually pretty great. I'm getting really addicted to it and had some great successes with my little playground. I think I get the hang of the array methods and wrote reusable functions and a validation with my RegEx. Every day I feel more pumped! :)

**Link to work:** [Average Winner](https://github.com/drood87/average-winner)

### Day 15: November 26 2018

**Today's Progress**: Still kept on working on my little average winner app. Haven't found the solution to my RegEx problem yet, but moved on to something a bit easier and actually played around with DOM and some animations. I want to finish this over the weekend and move on to something new, but this exercise already taught me quite a few things.

**Thoughts:** A lot of googling and a lot of learning. I'm feeling great and doing actually projects defs stretch my knowlegde and I'm feeling I'm moving forward. After finally getting the basics into my head I am feeling somehow confident to work with Javascript and it's really fun. It's the best part of the day when I get back home from work and can do some coding. I quit playing WoW now to concentrate more on coding.

**Link to work:** [Average Winner](https://github.com/drood87/average-winner)

### Day 16: November 27 2018

**Today's Progress**: Somehow finished the average-winner app. Still couldn't finish the validation process but will try that at a later stage. I did another Javascript30 challenge which would listen to a specific keysequence and display then unicorns. Also I started my own portfolio finally and added the header structure.

**Thoughts:** What an insane day of coding. The average-winner app works as intendet even though I still could not wrap my head around the validation process but will get back to that. I feel good that I finally started my own portfolio, which will be my mission over the next few weeks to finish that up.

### Day 17: November 28 2018

**Today's Progress**: Did the next challenge of Javascript30. Todays challenge was a key sequence detector

**Thoughts:** Javascript is fun! I mixed up my days a little and don't know what day I forgot to log. Oops.. will continue properly on the 1st of December

**Link to work:** [Key Sequence Detector](https://github.com/drood87/key-sequence-detection)

### Day 18: November 30 2018

**Today's Progress**: Project about Reference vs copy of Objects and Arrays

**Thoughts:** Javascript is fun! I mixed up my days a little and don't know what day I forgot to log. Oops.. will continue properly on the 1st of December

**Link to work:** [Key Sequence Detector](https://github.com/drood87/key-sequence-detection)

### Day 19: December 1 2018

**Today's Progress**: Build an app today which would save data in the local storage and remember if an item was checked on refreshing the site or not.

**Thoughts:** That was a bit complicated and defo have to review it and also have to implement some additional functions to strenghthen the new found knowledge.

**Link to work:** [Local Storage and Event Delegation](https://github.com/drood87/local-storage-and-event-delegation)

### Day 20: December 5 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today's exercise was on how to animate a box shadow on a text with Javascript and CSS. The Box shadow will move with the movement of the mousecursor.
Also I made a little progress on my portfolio. I am trying to make the hero section nice and tidy.

**Thoughts:** Doing my portfolio is really hard as I am never happy with the design and what I do. I have to get more confident and persistent in my doing and keep on going. The portfolio is probs the most important thing to publish and work on at the moment.

### Day 21: December 6 2018

**Today's Progress**: I worked on some array exercises today. The exercise was from Wes Bos JS30 course. I attempted to do it on my own and I succeeded!! :) We have an array with Band names and some with articles(`the`, `a`, `an`). The goal was to sort the array but not with their preceeding articles. After the sort the array should be displayed on the DOM in a list element.

**Thoughts:** That was pretty cool. It took me around 3 hours to finish the exercise and a lot of StackOverflowing and googling. But in the end I was successful and it feels damn great. Although my solution was a bit longer then Wes' solution but what matters is that I could finish this on my own.

**Link to work:** [Sorting Band names without article](https://github.com/drood87/sorting-band-names-withour-articles)

### Day 22: December 7 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued to work on my portfolio. I re-designed the hero section and implemented a parrallax effect on scrolling. On my name the text-shadow will subtle move with the user's mouse movement and I decided for a smooth gradient background.
Another tutorial I did was about on how to add up different lengths of videos and represent them in the right format.

**Thoughts:** My portfolio takes some shape and I'm pretty happy it does. I really like the gradient background and the moving text-shadow is pretty cool. Next I have to decide what I'll use for the about me section.

### Day 23: December 8 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today's tutorial was some playing around with the Webcam and how to apply filters on it. The video from the webcam gets drawn on the canvas element in HTML. You can take snapshots of the input and even download them in .jpeg format.

**Thoughts:** That was pretty complicated and I have to back reference to it and try to analyze it a bit more and get a better understanding of canvas in HTML and how to work with it properly.

### Day 24: December 9 2018

**Today's Progress**: We developed a speech recogniztion app today. This is native to Javascript. So now we can speak into our mic and what we said we be displayed on the DOM. The app creates a new `p` element when we stop talking and append the new `p` tag to the new sentence.

**Thoughts:** The native speech recogniztion from Javascript is really cool. It is not too compplicated and we can do a lot of fun stuff with it.

**Link to work:** [Speech recogniztion](https://github.com/drood87/speech-recognizition-js)

### Day 26: December 10 2018

**Today's Progress**: Did an exercise that allows Follow along links. Also I started learning some React at the long last. About on how to import components and style and reduce code.

**Thoughts:** React looks super interesting and can't wait to dive deeper in this framework. The work on my portfolio is still slow but I get some ideas and hope I get somewhere on the weekend and over the Christmas break.

**Link to work:** [Follow along links](https://github.com/drood87/follow-along-links)

### Day 27: December 11 2018

**Today's Progress**: Coded an app that uses the geolocation API from Javascript. This shows a compass that points to north and also shows the speed you're walking/ driving. The code is fairly short. We have a navigator.geolocation.watchPosition object which outputs the coords data.

**Thoughts:** I could not really test it out as I could not use any emulator with the project.

**Link to work:** [Geolocation based Speedometer and Compass](https://github.com/drood87/geolocation-based-speedometer-and-compass)

### Day 28: December 12 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked with the Javascript Speech-Synthesis API. We can type in a textbox whatever we want and then choose what voice, pitch and speed it gets read out. Our OS provides us with some native voices we can work with. The .getVoices() method can populate an array with the voices and then we can put these into a dropdown for the user to choose from.
I'm still working on my portfolio and trying different style designs.

**Thoughts:** The work for my portfolio is a real drag at the moment and harder then expected. I'm getting inspiration from several different portfolios and trying to implement them. I really want to work with soft bright colors but without having it looking childish or unprofessional.

**Link to work:** [Speech Synthesis](https://github.com/drood87/speech-synthesis)

### Day 29: December 13 2018

**Today's Progress**: I build a sticky nav bar with Javascript. As the user scrolls down the function will detect when the nav bar hits the top of the window and add a class of fixed-nav and makes it sticky. I had to make sure that the element underneath the nav bar adds extra padding as soon as the nav bar is fixed to the top as it would not take up any more space(behaves like it doesn't exist). We add extra padding to the element equals to the height of the navbar to mitigate the "jumping" of it.
I looked into more React and learned about state of components and how to pass them as props to different components.

**Thoughts:** The sticky navbar exercise was really useful and I will probably implement it in my own portfolio. The code is pretty simple and easy to implement.
React is pretty complicated with state,props,components. I think I have to work more on my JS skills to fully grasp the React syntax and how it works under the hood.

**Link to work:** [Sticky Nav](https://github.com/drood87/sticky-nav)

### Day 30: December 14 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learned about bubbling, propagation, capture and once. If we would have several HTML elements nested in each other and add event listeners to all elements it would bubble up all the way in the document and fire all events at once. If we would want to traverse down in the DOM, instead of bubbling up, we can use a third argument on an event listener called `capture`. `divs.forEach(div => div.addEventListener("click", myFunction, { capture: false }));`
This will then start from the top most element wich has an event listener attached.
If we want to avoid bubbling all together we would use `e.stopPropagation()`. This will just then target the clicked element and stop bubbling. Another useful method is `once: true/false` which we can also pass as a third argument on an event listener. This will fire the event then once and then unbind itself. This might be a useful thing if we had a button and we want the user just to click it once instead of multiple time(shopping Card for example).

**Thoughts:** These little methods are useful for some edgecases and might be helpful for some things. I understood the principles so far and I reckon I did a half decent job in explaining them to myself to remember it. I want to recapture the previous JS30 lessons and also write a little Lessons learned about each topic.

**Link to work:** [Bubbling, Propagation etc](https://github.com/drood87/event-capture-bubbling-concepts)

### Day 31: December 15 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I tried my waters in building a smooth transitioning nav dropdown menu. It's a mix of CSS and Javascript and actually just standart HTML and two elements that we need to built into our navbar to make it happen. The idea is that when you hover over a menuelement it will smoothly transition in and have a white background that resizes itself in respect to its content. We have a puppy div just before our actual nav content which will be our white background. We calculate the position and dimensions of the hovert element with `getBoundingClientRect()`(will show us the position of an element relative to the viewport). We have to pay attention that, if we have another element before the navbar, that we subtract the coords of that element as we can't always assume that the navbar is just a child of our window. We then add two seperat classes, of one which is set into a `setTimeout()` function to allow the smooth transition effect.

**Thoughts:** The effect of that is really cool and can be achieved with little effort. The concept itself is not too hard and I want to try to implement it into my own portfolio to make some cool effects. So a little recap of the first 31 days of the challenge. I learned so much just following along Wes Tutorials and I was finally able to start my own portfolio and get some shit done. I learned some really cool concepts and hope to implement it into my own work. I finally got started with React, but my main focus is still on sharpening my vanilla Javascript skills. My goal is, after finishing the JS30 course, to recap every single lesson and write a little lessons learned about it and to merge all projects into one repo. Of course, I might not have remembered everything but it is astounishing how much I actually know, just sharpening it with my own projects. I don't want to get stuck in the Tutorial hell but built my own stuff.

**Link to work:** [Smooth Dropdown Nav](https://github.com/drood87/follow-along-dropdown)

### Day 32: December 16 2018

**Today's Progress**: Did a little showcase that uses a drag and scroll effect. So basically the idea is, when, for example, we have a photo gallery, we can hold the mousekey down and can drag and scroll the pics to the left or right. For that we set up 4 event listeners that cover each event(mousedown, mousemove, mouseup, mouseleave). We set a flag variable of `isDown = false` which indicates if the mousebutton is held down or not. As soon as we hold the mouse down we set the boolean to `isDown = true` and save the coordinates on where we initially held the mouse down. If we have margins on the element we need to subtract the offset of the window to get the correct position of our click. We also set `event.preventDefault()` to avoid the standart browser behaviour of selecting a text for example. Most work is down in the mousemove function. We check first if `isDown = true` and if not we just stop the function from running all together and esace with `return`. IF the mouse is held down we get the coords of where we clicked with `e.pageX` to get the x Coords where we clicked and save that into a variable. We then go and calculate the actual move when we hold it down. `const x = e.pageX - slider.offsetLeft; // save every new x when cursor is moved const walk = (x - startX) * 3; slider.scrollLeft = scrollLeft - walk;`

**Thoughts:** Another project I can implement in my Portfolio at some point. My portfolio slowly gets somewhere. I could figure some small issues out and getting happier with the design. I really hope I am able to finish the site off still this year and put it online.

### Day 33: December 17 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I build a custom Video Speed Controller. I used the event handler of mousemove. So as soon as the event of a mousemoce occurs within the Speed Controller element we either increase or decrease the speed of the played video. We set variables of min and max speed to 0.4x and 4x, respectively. The HTML for the speedcontroller is not that fancy. It just has a `<div>` wrapped in another `<div>`. THe wrapper div is the full length of the bar whereas the inner div displays the actual speed of the video. So we grab the outer div and inner div and the video element within JS and put it into variables. We then create the event handler of mousemove and run the function `handleMove` and pass it the `event` as argument for the mousemove. In order to check where the user is moving the bar along the y axis we calculate the `e.pageY - this.offsetTop`. We do it like this cause we want to make sure we have the right position if there are any margins or paddings on the element(this.offsetTop). Then we just calculate the percentage of the playback speed `y / this.offsetTop`. After all the calculations we make sure the element gets styled properly according to our mouse movement and set the video playback rate to what we have calculated.

**Thoughts:** TO be honest I'm not really comfortable with all the maths involved with these exercises but I get the idea and how the things work. The code for that prototype is not all too hard and just a couple of lines Javascript. So that's pretty cool.

### Day 34: December 18 2018

**Today's Progress**: Todays project was a Countdown Timer. We can either choose one of the pre defined times or enter a custom time in minutes. This will then display a countdown as well as the time the countdown has run down. For this to work we need 4 functions. One that will take care of the actual timer which will take the seconds as an argument. First we will clear any running interval (in case there's already a timer running so we don't overlap several timers) and second we will run another function which will display the time left and invoke it straight away to make sure we start with the time we actual want, cause the `setInterval` will just start running after the first second already has passed. Then we have two more functions which will start the timer when we press one of the pre defined buttons with a time already associated with it. And the other function which will display the end Time and takes a timestamp as an argument. Timestamp will make sure we get an actual time instead of the 21328764 number that we get from `new Date()`.

**Thoughts:** This time my biggest takeaway was actually how to properly display the right time format (hh:mm:ss). It's easy with a simple ternary operator `${minutes}:${remainderSeconds < 10 ? "0" : ""}${remainderSeconds}`. I tried it before with an if statement and that failed, so I'm happy I could learn this and hopefully remember it the next time around. The next takeaway is, in order to clear a running interval we have to assign it to a variable and then we can call `clearInterval(variableOfRunningInterval)` to stop the Interval from executing.
