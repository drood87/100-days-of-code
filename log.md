# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 13 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started working on Wes Bos Javascript30 Course. And did a challenge on coderbyte.com

**Thoughts:** Getting better with Javascript feels amazing and added an additional feature to the Wes Bos Drum Kit set. Finishing a challenge on coderbyte made me really euphoric even though it was an easy one, but we all have to start somewhere :)

### Day 2: November 14 2018

**Today's Progress**: Day 2 with Wes Bos Javascript30 Course. Did the Clock and added an additional feature that shows us the time visually underneath the Clock. Goal is to implement a little feature additional to the project.

**Thoughts:** I learned some new tricks with CSS and how to work with Date Methods within Javascript. I digged a bit deeper into things I did not knew about which made me understand certains things better and jotted some notes down. Even if I do not look into the notes that often, or at all, it helps me manifest my thoughts better if I write them down and not just let them float around in my head.

### Day 3: November 15 2018

**Today's Progress**: Day 3 with Wes Bos Javascript30 Course. Learned some niffty tricks with CSS Variables and how to access them in Javascript. The additional feature I've added today is a quick color bar, where folks can click a color which then get applied instead of using the color picker.

**Thoughts:** The additional feature was really fun to code and harder then expected. But I learned how to get CSS properties within Javascript and save them to a variable to work with them and apply them to different elements. I get a little the hang of the keyword `this` which is pretty cool. It's super cool to add an additional feature to each exercise to become more creative and to deepen the understanding of each tutorial and also make it more unique. This challenge each day is really my highlight of the day! Also, instead of one hour of coding it was all of a sudden 3 hours! It's so much fun and I really hope that one day I can fulfill my dream to work in the industry and contribute to the tech industry!

### Day 4: November 16 2018

**Today's Progress**: Day 4 with Wes Bos Javascript30 Course. I learned in a hardcore array cardio session more about the array methods (map, filter, reduce, sort). I could take away some cool tricks and tips and will re-iterite the next few days.

**Thoughts:** Arrays are a pretty hard topic to grasp, at least for me, so far. I mean I get the methods but defo have to work on how it all works together. I have to re-iterite the exercises and really understand the concepts. I dug deeper into the sort() method and had to google why and how it sorts. I found out the JS Engine uses a sort algorithm and runs several times through arrays to sort them. We pass (a, b) in arguments and then can basically tell Javascript how we want to have it sort. In my case we used the return 1, return -1 statements to let it Bubble Sort up and down. It is still not 100% clear to me but practice makes perfect I guess. I really hope I get a better understanding in those. I have to work everyday on some arrays to really get the hang of it.

### Day 5: November 17 2018

**Today's Progress**: Day 5 with Wes Bos Javascript30 Course. Today we built an Image Gallery that relied heavily on Flexbox. If you click a panel it grows larger and text swoops in from the top and bottom. On another click the panel closes down again.

**Thoughts:** Was an awesome exercise. I was able to solo the exercise without watching the video, just the intro from Wes. I used arrays, and alot of methods I learned from the cardio yesterday and from the last few days. Although I could've done way easier probably, I'm pretty stoked that I actually was able to solve it and use the array methods. Coding everyday literally is great and the habit is what makes me stronger in coding and also the best practice! GO GO GO! :)

### Day 6: November 18 2018

**Today's Progress**: Day 6 with Wes Bos Javascript30 Course. This project was about how to fetch data from a JSON file and how to filter data out of a massive array and dynamically look through the array and show the results on the DOM. We used RegEx and data from an external JSON file. The array contained data about Cities and states in the USA. Also population and other information. Our goal was it that on user input the array gets searched with states and cities which are matching to the entered value. It also showed the population of the cities.
The second project I worked on was building a landing page for a client. I finished the HTML structure and also most of the CSS for the mobile version. I decided to build mobile first this time, from previous projects lessons learned.

**Thoughts:** The Javascript30 course gets really interesting and a bit harder. I have to look more into Regular Expressions are deepen my understanding how fetch and promises work. I think I could take away quite some knowledge and hope to apply it on something soon.
I am getting pretty fast in single HTML and CSS projects right now. I was able to finish most of the HTML structure for the landing page and most of the layout and CSS in an hour so two. It is just for mobile yet but I think the mobile first approach will work better out compared to desktop design first in previous iterations.

### Day 7: November 19 2018

**Today's Progress**: Day 7 with Wes Bos Javascript30 Course. We covered more array methods, like - .sort() .find() - and some more. Quite useful, now I jsut have to practice way more and use these methods dailies to get into it and get a better understanding of them.
I also finished the Huddle Landing Page with repsonsive design first.

**Thoughts:** I learn a shit tonne new Javascript every day now. It is quite hard to remember all of it, but I mostly get the concepts and think I can already do some cool stuff. I want to really find a little side project which I can make to manifest and cement what I've learned in my head.
I also finished the Huddle Landing page for the Coding challenge. I must say I am getting quite fast with just pure CSS and HTML. Although I'm gettign fast I have to get way better with my CSS I think. My mobile first approach worked out pretty cool, but my CSS still looks quite messy. But I'm having more fun with Javascript at the moment :p.

### Day 8: November 20 2018

**Today's Progress**: Day 8 with Wes Bos Javascript30 Course. The project was about HTML5 Canvas and how to manipulate and do fun things with it in Javascript. So when the user press' a mousekey down it would draw something on the canvas. We used HSL colors for that and as the hsl value increased so does the line. If the hsl value reaches its max of 360 it gets set back to 0 and start anew.

**Thoughts:** Canvas seems to be pretty tricky. If I want to use this I need to reference back to this project. It was a lot to take and kudos to Wes to learn and teach all that stuff. So yeah, learned a bit how to use and work with canvas in JS and make it interactive. Haven't used Canvas at all yet so it was something very new for me but really interesting. I have to keep it up!

### Day 9: November 21 2018

**Today's Progress**: Day 9 with Wes Bos Javascript30 Course. Today's tutorial was about some neat tricks what we can do within the Chrome Dev Tools. I also started a small project that will calculate and compare the BMI of 2 people. I did the HTML and styles and was able to get some variables declared and the function that runs the calculations is done but not yet complete.

**Thoughts:** THe tips and tricks for the Dev Tools in Chrome are very neat and I hope to utilise those further in my learning. The BMI calclator is a nice and easy project to get started and get more familiar with working in the DOM. I had some struggles with the Form element. I have to read further into this how to work with Forms within Javascript. But I was happy that I could figure a bug out why my calculations wouldn't show up in the console (hint: FORM!!)

### Day 10: November 22 2018

**Today's Progress**: Day 10 with Wes Bos Javascript30 Course. I started a project which lets you check several boxes within a range what you checked while holding down the shift key. I started it without watching Wes' Tutorial. I was able to find out that there is a method .shiftKey. I could get the index of the checked items. I still need to find out how to save the index and get the items in between the two checked boxed to be checked then.

**Thoughts:** It was pretty hard for me to do on my own. But I could make a slow progress and played with some methods and just went the trial and error path. Some things worked out but mostly not yet. Also I was sick. :D But I think with some more persistence and maybe having a sneak at the tutorial I'll figure it out somehow.

### Day 12: November 24 2018

**Today's Progress**: I learned about npm packages and had my first real contact to .json files.I could add scripts in the .json that would run scripts from the terminal. I learned a little about how to import packages from npm and what dependencies in a project are. What are the benefits (re-usable code from other Dev's so we don't have to) and disadvantages (bloated projects, large file sizes, alot of dependencies are hard to maintain) of it.

**Thoughts:** Today I took a day off of hardcore coding and got a bit familiar with npm and dependencies and some nice packages what we can use from npm. It was nice to get the head off a little bit and learn something new exciting. Can't wait to play around more with it.

### Day 13: November 25 2018

**Today's Progress**: We build a custom HTML5 video player with Javascript. It allows you to scrub through the video, change volume and videospeed.
Also, I started a coding challenge which allows you to calculate the average score of three different teams from three different games and then tells us who won in average.
I started the design with HTML and CSS, using flexbox.

**Thoughts:** The Javascript30 is getting pretty tough for my knowledge but it's amazing what we can do with just these technologies. I will try to get a bit more familiar with more the basics and do the coding challenges from the other Udemy course to double down on the basics and then incrementely do more complicated stuff. I have fun working with the DOM and really have to learn to concentrate on one project instead of trying to do all at once.

### Day 14: November 26 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the coding challenge of the average winner. Implemented a regular Expression(yay) and some of the array methods. So far it works great. I used the animate.css library to animate my image and my Regular Expression validates that the user only inputs numbers and not any characters.

**Thoughts:** Wow, today was actually pretty great. I'm getting really addicted to it and had some great successes with my little playground. I think I get the hang of the array methods and wrote reusable functions and a validation with my RegEx. Every day I feel more pumped! :)

### Day 15: November 27 2018

**Today's Progress**: Still kept on working on my little average winner app. Haven't found the solution to my RegEx problem yet, but moved on to something a bit easier and actually played around with DOM and some animations. I want to finish this over the weekend and move on to something new, but this exercise already taught me quite a few things.

**Thoughts:** A lot of googling and a lot of learning. I'm feeling great and doing actually projects defs stretch my knowlegde and I'm feeling I'm moving forward. After finally getting the basics into my head I am feeling somehow confident to work with Javascript and it's really fun. It's the best part of the day when I get back home from work and can do some coding. I quit playing WoW now to concentrate more on coding.
