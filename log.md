# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 13 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started working on Wes Bos Javascript30 Course. And did a challenge on coderbyte.com

**Thoughts:** Getting better with Javascript feels amazing and added an additional feature to the Wes Bos Drum Kit set. Finishing a challenge on coderbyte made me really euphoric even though it was an easy one, but we all have to start somewhere :)

### Day 2: November 14 2018

**Today's Progress**: Day 2 with Wes Bos Javascript30 Course. Did the Clock and added an additional feature that shows us the time visually underneath the Clock. Goal is to implement a little feature additional to the project.

**Thoughts:** I learned some new tricks with CSS and how to work with Date Methods within Javascript. I digged a bit deeper into things I did not knew about which made me understand certains things better and jotted some notes down. Even if I do not look into the notes that often, or at all, it helps me manifest my thoughts better if I write them down and not just let them float around in my head.

### Day 3: November 15 2018

**Today's Progress**: Day 3 with Wes Bos Javascript30 Course. Learned some niffty tricks with CSS Variables and how to access them in Javascript. The additional feature I've added today is a quick color bar, where folks can click a color which then get applied instead of using the color picker.

**Thoughts:** The additional feature was really fun to code and harder then expected. But I learned how to get CSS properties within Javascript and save them to a variable to work with them and apply them to different elements. I get a little the hang of the keyword `this` which is pretty cool. It's super cool to add an additional feature to each exercise to become more creative and to deepen the understanding of each tutorial and also make it more unique. This challenge each day is really my highlight of the day! Also, instead of one hour of coding it was all of a sudden 3 hours! It's so much fun and I really hope that one day I can fulfill my dream to work in the industry and contribute to the tech industry!

### Day 4: November 16 2018

**Today's Progress**: Day 4 with Wes Bos Javascript30 Course. I learned in a hardcore array cardio session more about the array methods (map, filter, reduce, sort). I could take away some cool tricks and tips and will re-iterite the next few days.

**Thoughts:** Arrays are a pretty hard topic to grasp, at least for me, so far. I mean I get the methods but defo have to work on how it all works together. I have to re-iterite the exercises and really understand the concepts. I dug deeper into the sort() method and had to google why and how it sorts. I found out the JS Engine uses a sort algorithm and runs several times through arrays to sort them. We pass (a, b) in arguments and then can basically tell Javascript how we want to have it sort. In my case we used the return 1, return -1 statements to let it Bubble Sort up and down. It is still not 100% clear to me but practice makes perfect I guess. I really hope I get a better understanding in those. I have to work everyday on some arrays to really get the hang of it.
