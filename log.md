# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 13 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Started working on Wes Bos Javascript30 Course. And did a challenge on coderbyte.com

**Thoughts:** Getting better with Javascript feels amazing and added an additional feature to the Wes Bos Drum Kit set. Finishing a challenge on coderbyte made me really euphoric even though it was an easy one, but we all have to start somewhere :)
