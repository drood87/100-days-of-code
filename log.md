# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 13 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started working on Wes Bos Javascript30 Course. And did a challenge on coderbyte.com

**Thoughts:** Getting better with Javascript feels amazing and added an additional feature to the Wes Bos Drum Kit set. Finishing a challenge on coderbyte made me really euphoric even though it was an easy one, but we all have to start somewhere :)

### Day 2: November 14 2018

**Today's Progress**: Day 2 with Wes Bos Javascript30 Course. Did the Clock and added an additional feature that shows us the time visually underneath the Clock. Goal is to implement a little feature additional to the project.

**Thoughts:** I learned some new tricks with CSS and how to work with Date Methods within Javascript. I digged a bit deeper into things I did not knew about which made me understand certains things better and jotted some notes down. Even if I do not look into the notes that often, or at all, it helps me manifest my thoughts better if I write them down and not just let them float around in my head.

### Day 3: November 15 2018

**Today's Progress**: Day 3 with Wes Bos Javascript30 Course. Learned some niffty tricks with CSS Variables and how to access them in Javascript. The additional feature I've added today is a quick color bar, where folks can click a color which then get applied instead of using the color picker.

**Thoughts:** The additional feature was really fun to code and harder then expected. But I learned how to get CSS properties within Javascript and save them to a variable to work with them and apply them to different elements. I get a little the hang of the keyword `this` which is pretty cool. It's super cool to add an additional feature to each exercise to become more creative and to deepen the understanding of each tutorial and also make it more unique. This challenge each day is really my highlight of the day! Also, instead of one hour of coding it was all of a sudden 3 hours! It's so much fun and I really hope that one day I can fulfill my dream to work in the industry and contribute to the tech industry!

### Day 4: November 16 2018

**Today's Progress**: Day 4 with Wes Bos Javascript30 Course. I learned in a hardcore array cardio session more about the array methods (map, filter, reduce, sort). I could take away some cool tricks and tips and will re-iterite the next few days.

**Thoughts:** Arrays are a pretty hard topic to grasp, at least for me, so far. I mean I get the methods but defo have to work on how it all works together. I have to re-iterite the exercises and really understand the concepts. I dug deeper into the sort() method and had to google why and how it sorts. I found out the JS Engine uses a sort algorithm and runs several times through arrays to sort them. We pass (a, b) in arguments and then can basically tell Javascript how we want to have it sort. In my case we used the return 1, return -1 statements to let it Bubble Sort up and down. It is still not 100% clear to me but practice makes perfect I guess. I really hope I get a better understanding in those. I have to work everyday on some arrays to really get the hang of it.

### Day 5: November 17 2018

**Today's Progress**: Day 5 with Wes Bos Javascript30 Course. Today we built an Image Gallery that relied heavily on Flexbox. If you click a panel it grows larger and text swoops in from the top and bottom. On another click the panel closes down again.

**Thoughts:** Was an awesome exercise. I was able to solo the exercise without watching the video, just the intro from Wes. I used arrays, and alot of methods I learned from the cardio yesterday and from the last few days. Although I could've done way easier probably, I'm pretty stoked that I actually was able to solve it and use the array methods. Coding everyday literally is great and the habit is what makes me stronger in coding and also the best practice! GO GO GO! :)

### Day 6: November 18 2018

**Today's Progress**: Day 6 with Wes Bos Javascript30 Course. This project was about how to fetch data from a JSON file and how to filter data out of a massive array and dynamically look through the array and show the results on the DOM. We used RegEx and data from an external JSON file. The array contained data about Cities and states in the USA. Also population and other information. Our goal was it that on user input the array gets searched with states and cities which are matching to the entered value. It also showed the population of the cities.
The second project I worked on was building a landing page for a client. I finished the HTML structure and also most of the CSS for the mobile version. I decided to build mobile first this time, from previous projects lessons learned.

**Thoughts:** The Javascript30 course gets really interesting and a bit harder. I have to look more into Regular Expressions are deepen my understanding how fetch and promises work. I think I could take away quite some knowledge and hope to apply it on something soon.
I am getting pretty fast in single HTML and CSS projects right now. I was able to finish most of the HTML structure for the landing page and most of the layout and CSS in an hour so two. It is just for mobile yet but I think the mobile first approach will work better out compared to desktop design first in previous iterations.

### Day 7: November 19 2018

**Today's Progress**: Day 7 with Wes Bos Javascript30 Course. We covered more array methods, like - .sort() .find() - and some more. Quite useful, now I jsut have to practice way more and use these methods dailies to get into it and get a better understanding of them.
I also finished the Huddle Landing Page with repsonsive design first.

**Thoughts:** I learn a shit tonne new Javascript every day now. It is quite hard to remember all of it, but I mostly get the concepts and think I can already do some cool stuff. I want to really find a little side project which I can make to manifest and cement what I've learned in my head.
I also finished the Huddle Landing page for the Coding challenge. I must say I am getting quite fast with just pure CSS and HTML. Although I'm gettign fast I have to get way better with my CSS I think. My mobile first approach worked out pretty cool, but my CSS still looks quite messy. But I'm having more fun with Javascript at the moment :p.
